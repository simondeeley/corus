This makes the framework - and the codebase of any application derived form it - more interoperable, flexible and testable. Many thanks to [illibejiep](http://illibejiep.com/) and his [TrueDI](https://github.com/illibejiep/TrueDI) for the inspiration and original codebase from which this project is heavily based.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n* PHP >= 5.6\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nThe recommended way to install Corus is using Composer. You can either install Composer per-project or globally following the instructions on their website. Once Composer is installed, simply add Corus to your dependencies - the quick and easy way is by using the command line:\r\n\r\n    composer require corus-framework/corus\r\n    \r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nWatch this space...\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\nMany thanks to [illibejiep](http://illibejiep.com/) and his implementation of true dependency injection [TrueDI](https://github.com/illibejiep/TrueDI) from which this library is derived.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
