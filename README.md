A fast dependency injection framework based on Symfony components

Corus is a micro-framework which aims to be a true dependency injection environment where using the container as a service locator is actively avoided. This makes the framework - and the codebase of any application derived form it - more interoperable, flexible and testable. Many thanks to [illibejiep](http://illibejiep.com/) and his [TrueDI](https://github.com/illibejiep/TrueDI) for the inspiration and original codebase from which this project is heavily based.
